## Lab 1: Digital Circuit Design
Introduction to Verilog. Designed basic circuits, including ORs, ANDs, and muxes.

## Lab 2: Arithmetic Logic Unit
Built a 32-bit ALU supporting the following operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOR, ADD, SUB, SLT, SRL, SLL, SRA. 

## Lab 3: Memory and FSM
Intro to sequential logic. Built a memory consisting of three tapes, each composed of registers. Implemented a FSM and used FSM and memory to implement a simple 8-bit adder capable of running on the FPGA.

## Lab 4: Building a MIPS Multicycle CPU
Built a multicycle CPU able to run a subset of the MIPS ISA, including and, or, xor, nor, sll, srl, sra, slt, add, sub, andi, ori, xori, slti, addi, beq, bne, lw, sw, j, jal, and jr instructions.
